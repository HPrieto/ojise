                    <p> I have studied extensively on Yoruba culture and have become verily groomed as a "true Yoruba" to dispute the arguments of many modern day Yoruba so called "elders" on the issue of respect.  Your tactics is the trait of members of your woeful generation who uses respect to sweep vital issues under the carpet when the younger ones demands for accountability.  Even Tafa Balogun (former Police IG) demanded respect and his lawyers declared that he not be handcuffed whilst being tried for embezzling millions of dollars.  So what else is new? </p>

                    <p>Respect should be earned just like your titles of “Babalaje” and “Aare" rather than be bought with money as commonplace in your generation.</p>

                    <p>I reckoned with your story of how you came to Lagos from Abeokuta with nothing and the hard work that put you through what you became today, having a family whilst training yourself in school is a splendid value.  Though commendable, your story is not unique for people that are driven.  I have a similar story...</p>

                    <p>So you can point fingers as to the lack of home training in me (if indeed that is what you mean)?  The bottom line is God has chosen to train me and my siblings in spite of the degenerate upbringing that we had. </p>

                    <p>It takes both home-training and self-training to be a responsible individual (Bibi-ire and Atunra-bi). The present day Yoruba "elders" lacks self training (ATUNRABI) and are very crafty indeed.  When the youth demand integrity from degenerate fathers like you, who has created difficult environment for their "children" because of their compromised sense of integrity (my father inclusive), they start demanding for respect and point fingers at upbringing.  People with wrong upbringing can tune themselves.   Apparently I and my siblings have done a very good job and you should give us accolades for that.</p>

                    <p> Look around you sir.  NEPA, NITEL, Nigerian Airports, Roads, Fire Brigade, Police,  etc.  Compared these infrastructures and entities to what they have in South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, and some other countries who got thier independence at about the same time that Nigeria did (these countries don't even have anything close to the mineral wealth than Nigeria has).   I will not mention the US, Canada or countries in western Europe because it is not fair to compare them with Nigeria. Why do you think this countries that are in the same socio-economic polity with Nigeria in the 1960s are developing and Nigeria remains comparably underdeveloped?  It is because of people of your traits that are far too commonplace in your generation.  The self-centered self-absorbed greedy egocentric wicked and woeful generation.  Isn't it your generation that started using youths as hired assassins against one another for political and economic gains?  Where in Yoruba history have you read of such rampant evil being done to fellow humans at the scale that is done in your generation.</p>

                    <p> Lack of integrity, compromised transparency, utter disrespect for due process and accountability were the code of conduct of your generation.   You did not inherit these conducts from your fathers (my grandfathers generation). You witnessed oil boom and squandered it.  You prefer to embezzle money and expect the youths to prostrate themselves before you and give crumbles of bread rather than create an environment whereby the youths will excel and contribute their God given talents to society.  You are part of the Woeful Generation, my own father inclusive.    History will never forgive your generation for the chaos that you’ve caused.</p>
